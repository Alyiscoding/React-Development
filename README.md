Got it! You have a **monorepo** — a single GitHub repository that contains **multiple separate MERN stack projects** inside it.

Here’s a tailored `README.md` for your repo that:

* Describes the overall repo
* Lists all included projects
* Explains how to run each individually
* Can be easily updated when you add more projects

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each project has its own frontend and backend. To run them:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-projects.git
cd mern-projects
````

---

### 2. Running a Specific Project (Example: Task Manager)

#### Backend

```bash
cd task-manager/server
npm install
# Add .env file with PORT, MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET
npm run dev
```

#### Frontend

```bash
cd ../client
npm install
npm start
```

> Repeat the same pattern for other projects inside their folders.

---

## 🌐 Deployment

Each project is deployable separately.
You can deploy frontend with **Vercel/Netlify** and backend with **Render/Railway**.

Make sure to:

* Update API URLs in frontend (`.env` or hardcoded fetch URLs)
* Set environment variables in deployed platforms

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack Used

* **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS, Flowbite UI
* **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
* **Database:** MongoDB + Mongoose
* **Auth:** JWT + bcrypt
* **Deployment:** Vercel, Render, Railway
